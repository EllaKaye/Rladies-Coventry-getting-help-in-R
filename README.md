Meetup details [here](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-coventry/events/273429872/).

## Abstract

This session will be led by Ella Kaye - an R enthusiast and statistics PhD researcher at the University of Warwick. In the session, Ella will talk us through different ways to get help when you get stuck on a problem in R. We’ll cover how and where to look for answers and how to ask and post good questions that make it easy for others to help you, including a demo of the excellent `reprex` and `datapasta` packages. So whether you’re an R novice or more experienced R user, hopefully there’ll be some useful tips for you!

## Bio

Hello! I am a PhD student in Statistics at the University of Warwick. I am part of the [OxWaSP programme](http://www.oxwasp-cdt.ac.uk). I am interested in Applied Statistics, particularly as applied in the Social Sciences. I am currently working on a project analysing data from applications to undergraduate statistics courses in the Statistics department at Warwick. I am supervised by [Dr Julia Brettschneider](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/brettschneider/) and [Dr Anastasia Papavasiliou](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/papavasiliou/).

I am an R enthusiast. I am the author, along with [Prof David Firth](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/firth/) of the `BradleyTerryScalable package`, which is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/EllaKaye/BradleyTerryScalable). I am co-organiser of the [Oxford R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Oxford-R-User-Group/) and also a member of the [Warwick R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Warwick-useRs/).

Prior to the PhD, my academic path has taken me from a BA in Mathematics and Philosophy (University of Oxford), through an MA in History and Philosophy of Science and Technology (University of Toronto), an MPhil in Mathematics Education (University of Cambridge) and an MSc in Applied Statistics (University of Oxford). I also have a PGCE in Secondary Mathematics, have taught at secondary school, and worked in market research.
