# GETTING HELP IN R

.larger[Ella Kaye | Rladies Coventry | October 29th, 2020]

# Me and R

- Studying for a PhD in Statistics at the University of Warwick

- Getting into R:

  - 2014: first R course as part of Statistics MSc 
  - 2015: first taste of `ggplot2` 
  - 2016: first R package 
  - 2017: first community involvement (useR!2017, [Oxford R User Group](https://r-oxford.github.io), [rainbowR](https://rainbowr.slack.com), [@R_LGBTQ](https://twitter.com/R_LGBTQ))
  - 2020: first [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) contribution
  - 2021: first ...

# LOOKING FOR ANSWERS

---

class: center, middle, inverse

# In R

---

# Within R - Help with functions

```{r eval = FALSE}
# help with a specific function
help(function_name)
?function_name

# quick reminder of the function arguments
arg(function_name)

# see an example
example(function_name)

# see the source code
function_name
```

---
# Within R - `help.search`

```{r eval = FALSE}
# when ?function_name fails (e.g. don't have library loaded)
help.search("function_name") # note quotation marks
??function_name

# for when you can't quite remember the function name
??something_like_function_name
```

---

# Within R - Help with package

```{r eval = FALSE}
# `help`
help(package = "package_name")
# Help panel in RStudio will give links to all documentation
# and help pages for that package

# find/browse vignettes for installed (or specific) packages
browseVignettes()
browseVignettes("package_name")

# use auto-completion in RStudio to see what functions 
# are in a package
?package::
```

# Searching online

- In Google, include "r" and package name in your search and avoid extra words

  - Check how recent the result is

- Use [rseek.org](https://rseek.org) to search R documentation, discussion forums, blogs

- Can also try [symbolhound.com](http://symbolhound.com/) if search term contains symbols

- [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org) for ethical search

- If trying to get help with an error, include the entire error message

- Use tags in [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)

  - Check a few answers, read comments
  - Reputation (e.g. number of up-votes) can be a good guide

---

# Issues on GitHub page

- Check if it's a known problem awaiting a fix

- commenting means you'll be notified of a fix

## Typology of questions

From [this](https://masalmon.eu/2018/07/22/wheretogethelp/) excellent blog, 'Where to get with your R questions' by Maëlle Salmon.


- **Problem**

  - Is this a bug? Why is this code not working? How can I successfully install the `rJava` package?

- **Question**

  - Is there a tool in R for doing foo? How do I learn about `bar`?

- **Debate**

  - What is the best plotting library in R? Should I learn base R or tidyverse first?

# Reproducible

# Minimal

# Verifiable

---


# reproducible

  - You need to capture everything

    - `library()` calls at the top
    - all necessary objects. 

---

# minimal

  - Strip away everything that is not directly related to your problem. 
  
  - Small, simple data objects (usually much smaller than what you're actually working with).
  
  - Preferably built-in, familiar data sets, e.g. `mtcars` or  [others](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html)
  
  - use [datapasta]([https://github.com/milesmcbain/datapasta) when working with your own data, or data outside of R
    - `datapasta` demo
  
---

# verifiable

  - Actually reproduces the problem!

- Explain steps (using comments or rmarkdown)

- Include error messages, and possibly output of `sessionInfo()`

- Include what you've tried to fix it

---

# Can be a lot of effort, but often the process of coming up with a good **repr**oducible **ex**ample (**reprex**) allows you to identify (and possibly solve) the problem

---

# The `reprex` package

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("reprex")

# Included as part of the tidyverse
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

The goal of a reprex is to package your problematic code in such a way that other people can run it and feel your pain. Then, hopefully, they can provide a solution and put you out of your misery.

---

# Basic `reprex` steps

- write some R code
- copy it
- run `reprex()` (or use RStudio addin)
- check locally
- paste into target

---

# `reprex()` demo

# All things `reprex`

Jenny Bryan's `reprex` RStudio workshop:

- [Video](https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/help-me-help-you-creating-reproducible-examples/)
- [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/reprex-reproducible-examples-with-r)

# Where to ask?

---
## Where to ask **problem** questions

- For bugs/issues related to a particular package, file an issue (usually GitHub)

  - CRAN package page, `BugReports` url (e.g. [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html))
  - Bioconductor page, `BugReports` url (e.g. [treeio](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/treeio.html))
  
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) (using tags, e.g. [r], [tidyverse], [ropensci])

- Community forums:

  - [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com) for questions relating to RStudio IDE, tidyverse, package development and plenty more
  
  - For questions related to open science, reproducibility, documenting data, extracting data out of something (a PDF! a PNG!), package development, rOpenSci’s [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) might be the right venue.

---

## Where to ask **question** or **debate** questions
  
- [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com) or [rOpenSci’s discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) (see above),

- [R epidemics consortium](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/forum/)

- [R for Data Science](https://www.rfordatasci.com) online community, [Slack](https://rforsatascience.slack.com) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/R4DScommunity). 
  - Learners/mentors/community/office hours. 

- R [mailing lists](https://www.r-project.org/mail.html): 5 main and 22 special interest

- Google groups: e.g. [ggplot2](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ggplot2) and [manipulatr](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/manipulatr) for tidyverse data manipulation queries

- Twitter [\#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats)
  
---

# Twitter, R and #rstats

- [\#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats) twitter is a friendly place

Good for:

- Easily/quickly answered questions (e.g. is there a package to do foo?)
- Debate questions 

Not good for:

- Tagging package maintainers
- Too much code
- Problem questions (unless sharing a link to the question elsewhere)
